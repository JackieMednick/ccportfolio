            <h2>Hello Everone!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my about me page! Here I will talk a little about myself, my future goals, and my thoughts on this semester.</p>
            
            <h3>Me</h3>
            <p>I am currently studying Design and Technology with a minor in film production at Parsons School of Design in New York City. I have always been passionate about film production and just recently found interest in coding. I grew up in Annapolis, Maryland and loved it there, but have always loved New York City and knew I wanted to go to college there. In my free time I enjoy being social, going to concerts, watching movies and being around my friends.</p>
            
            <h3>My Future</h3>
            <p>My goal is to work in the film industry in the future.  I enjoy making short films as well as analyzing films, including their music, cinematography, and storyline.  I do enjoy design and technology, and I believe that understanding these topics can be helpful for the film industry, especially when it comes to the backstage production of some technological elements. One day, I would love to work as a producer and produce my own movie.</p>
            
            <h3>Reflection on this semester</h3>
            <p>Over the past few months, my relationship with technology has definitely improved. I've discovered a lot of material that I had never heard of, and this has me motivated to study more in the future. Many of these assignments have been difficult, but once I realized what I needed to do, it was really fascinating and fun to see it play out. This semester was very exciting, and I'm looking forward to what lies ahead.</p>
