    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The Outline for Project 1 was to "draw an object described to you in plain language through code". The object described to me by a classmate was a simple red portfolio, holding her artwork, that she had previously lost. This was the first time I have ever used P5.js so it took me a while to figure everything out.</p>
